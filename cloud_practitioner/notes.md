# What is Cloud Computing ?

## Traditional IT Overview

An simple example to demonstrate how website works is that we as the Client (using web browser) want to get access to the Server to visualise a website, through a network. The data packet gets routed though the network to the Server and the Server will get back to us, so that we can view the website. Both the Client and the Server has IP address which can be used to send/receive requests. 


So what is in the Server ?     
CPU: computation and finding results.        
RAM: fast memory (storing and retrieving quickly)       
Storage: long term storage of data              
Database: for large structured data      
Network tools: routers, switch, DNS server, etc.       

So what is in the network ?       
Cables: obviously       
Router: networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks        
Switch: when the data packet arrives at the destination, the switch will send the packet to the correct Server/Client on the network.      
So in summary it looks like this:
